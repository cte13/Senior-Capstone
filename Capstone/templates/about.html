	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>

	This website has been created by three <a href="http://ischool.uw.edu/">Informatics</a> majors studying at the University of Washington.
	We are Jeff Cairns, Misha Tsao and Cory Eurom. </p> 

	<p>A "Capstone Project" is a six-month long project which requires groups of 3-5 students to solve an
	information problem. This information problem is all about gathering, organizing and analyzing data.</p> 
	 
	</p>

	<p>
	In the wake of events such as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers' target='_blank'>Lehman Brothers</a> declaring bankruptcy
	and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_madoff' target='_blank'>Bernie Madoff</a> being born with the perfect name, 
	the federal government has mandated increased transparency throughout the financial sector. Legislation like the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doddâ€“Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act'
	target-'_blank'>Dodd-Frank Act</a> requires companies to submit nearly every piece of financial information. This makes investing safe again. That is, if you take
	advantage of the data.</p>

	<p>
	XBRL is a machine-readable language. Imagine you are the SEC and you legislate <em>every</em> company in the US to submit data to you. There are no technical
	specifications to the format of the data therefore anything is accepted. Data flows in like a tornado from Kansas; scanned accounting papers, JPEGs,
	PDFs, XLSX, TXT, anything! Introducing XBRL: The future of financial reporting. XBRL is an extension of XML.
	It is formatted in the exact same way with minor changes and the inclusion of lateral taxonomies. Read more about it <a href='http://jeffcacapstone.blogspot.com/2013/02/become-familiar-with-xbrl.html' target='_blank'>at Jeff's blog.</a> 

	</p>

	<p>
	This website collects data from the SEC. The process is as follows:
	<ol>
	<li>Companies submit financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission</li>
	<li>The data is then available to anyone in the public</li>
	<li>We receive the latest reports every ten minutes. These reports are sent to a database</li>
	<li>Users submit PHP requests to the database with specific criteria</li>
	<li>Poof! There the data is</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>

	We would like to thank Marisa Quinn, Eric Larsen and Doug Cairns of BlackRock Inc. for providing us this opportunity.
