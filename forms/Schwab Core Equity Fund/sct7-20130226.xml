  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005521_Member">The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of other Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds. The fund may also invest in unaffiliated third party mutual funds (referred to herein as unaffiliated funds and, together with Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds, the underlying funds). The fund invests in the underlying funds in accordance with its target portfolio allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The fund is managed based on the specific retirement date (target date) included in its name and assumes a retirement age of 65. The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely would stop making new investments in the fund. The fund is designed for an investor who anticipates retiring at or about the target date and plans to withdraw the value of the investor's account in the fund gradually after retirement. As described below, the adviser will continue to modify the fund's target asset allocation for 20 years beyond the target date. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund's target asset allocation will be adjusted annually based on the adviser's asset allocation strategy; however, the adviser reserves the right to modify the fund's target asset allocations from time to time should circumstances warrant a change. In general, the fund's allocation to equity securities will decrease and its allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the fund approaches its target retirement date. The fund's asset allocation as of January 7, 2013 was approximately 39% equity securities, 55% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). The fund will continue to reduce its allocation to equity securities for 20 years beyond the fund's stated target date. At such time, the fund's asset allocation will remain fixed at approximately 25% equity securities, 66% fixed income securities, and 9% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the strategic annual adjustment of the fund's target asset allocation, the adviser may adjust the fund's underlying fund allocations within a particular asset class based on the following considerations, including, but not limited to, market trends, its outlook for a given market capitalization, and the underlying funds' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular underlying fund may increase or decrease throughout the year. Within the equity asset class, the fund will have exposure to one or more "style classes". For example, the style classes include domestic large-cap equity, domestic small-cap equity, and international equity. The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

Index funds typically invest in the securities included in the index they are tracking, and generally give each security the same weight as the index does. The underlying funds may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend their securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. Each underlying fund focuses on a different market segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio manager monitors the portfolio's holdings and cash flow and manages them as needed in order to maintain the portfolio's target allocation.

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005521_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.   &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

It is the portfolio&amp;#146;s policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in stock investments; typically the actual percentage is considerably higher. The portfolio invests in mutual funds to achieve its allocation in stock investments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portfolio&amp;#146;s allocation focuses on stock investments for long-term growth. The portfolio seeks to remain close to the target allocations of 45% in large-cap, 30% in international and 25% in small-cap stocks and typically does not change its target allocation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the portfolio must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations, the portfolio&amp;#146;s actual investments will be slightly less than 100% in stock funds.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portfolio invests mainly in other Schwab Funds&lt;sup style="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;, particularly three of the Equity Index Funds.

They typically invest in the stocks included in the index they are tracking, and generally give each stock the same weight as the index does. The underlying funds may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend their securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. Each underlying fund focuses on a different segment of the stock market.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portfolio manager monitors the portfolio&amp;#146;s holdings and cash flow and manages them as needed in order to maintain the portfolio&amp;#146;s target allocation.

Each underlying fund invests its assets in a different segment of the equity or fixed income market in accordance with its own investment objectives and policies. Normally, the fund invests 55-65% of its assets in equity securities (including stocks and equity funds) and 35-45% in fixed income securities (including bonds and fixed income funds), and cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). This allocation is designed to provide a mix of the growth opportunities of stock investing with the income opportunities of bonds and other fixed income securities. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 25% of its assets in equity securities and at least 25% of its assets in fixed income securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Within the equity fund allocation, the portfolio manager typically allocates the fund's investments among underlying large-cap and small-cap stock funds, but may also invest in international stock funds or other equity funds with an international component, including underlying funds with some exposure to emerging market securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the fixed income fund allocation, the portfolio manager allocates investments among underlying bond funds based on a number of factors including total return potential and the maturities and credit quality of their holdings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, as well as other mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) to maintain its asset allocations. The underlying funds may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations.

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000006549_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Equity and fixed income markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.   &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Large- and Mid-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Both large- and mid-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. However, stocks of mid-cap companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies. During a period when large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments -  small-cap stocks, for instance - an underlying fund's large-and mid-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks, and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments - large-cap and mid-cap stocks, for instance - an underlying fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Growth Investing Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's investments in growth stocks can be volatile. Growth companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their businesses and may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market. The prices of growth stocks are based largely on projections of the issuer's future earnings and revenues. If a company's earnings or revenues fall short of expectations, its stock price may fall dramatically. Growth stocks may also be more expensive relative to their earnings or assets compared to value or other stocks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause a fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    ETF Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  When an underlying fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with an underlying fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on an underlying fund. However, these risks are less severe when the underlying fund uses derivatives for hedging rather than to enhance the underlying fund's returns or as a substitute for a position or security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the underlying fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund. The use of leverage may cause the underlying fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Certain underlying funds engage in securities lending, which involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Mortgage Dollar Rolls Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Mortgage dollar rolls are transactions in which an underlying fund sells mortgage-backed securities to a dealer and simultaneously agrees to repurchase similar securities in the future at a predetermined price. An underlying fund's mortgage dollar rolls could lose money if the price of the mortgage-backed securities sold falls below the agreed upon repurchase price, or if the counterparty is unable to honor the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, as well as other mutual funds or ETFs, to maintain its asset allocations.

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005916_Member">The portfolio is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The portfolio&amp;#146;s principal risks include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The portfolio is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the portfolio&amp;#146;s assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the portfolio to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser&amp;#146;s authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the portfolio and is legally obligated to act in the portfolio&amp;#146;s best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stock markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the portfolio will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The value of your investment in the portfolio is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the portfolio purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the portfolio, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the portfolio may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the portfolio&amp;#146;s exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the portfolio&amp;#146;s overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.  &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The portfolio may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Some underlying funds seek to track the performance of various segments of the stock market, as measured by their respective indices. Each underlying fund follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of their indexing strategy, the underlying funds do not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of an underlying fund&amp;#146;s expenses, the underlying fund&amp;#146;s performance is normally below that of the index. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Tracking Error Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Each underlying index fund seeks to track the performance of its benchmark index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of a fund and its benchmark index, positive or negative, is called &amp;#147;tracking error.&amp;#148; Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Many of the risks of the underlying funds are associated with its investment in the large-cap segments of the stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when large-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; an underlying fund&amp;#146;s large-cap holdings could reduce performance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks, and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; an underlying fund&amp;#146;s small-cap holdings could reduce performance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund&amp;#146;s investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As a result of an underlying fund&amp;#146;s investments in securities denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. This is the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency hedged. In either event, the dollar value of an investment in a fund would be adversely affected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund&amp;#146;s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF&amp;#146;s expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value of being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers, and other financial institutions. Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The portfolio may invest directly in individual securities as well as other mutual funds or ETFs, to maintain its allocations. The portfolio&amp;#146;s direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund&amp;#146;s investment in the same security.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the portfolio please see the &amp;#147;Portfolio details&amp;#148; section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005919_Member">The portfolio is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The portfolio's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The portfolio is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the portfolio's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the portfolio to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the portfolio and is legally obligated to act in the portfolio's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the portfolio will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;The value of your investment in the portfolio is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the portfolio purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the portfolio, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the portfolio may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the portfolio's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the portfolio's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The portfolio may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Some underlying funds seek to track the performance of various segments of the stock market, as measured by their respective indices. Each underlying fund follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of their indexing strategy, the underlying funds do not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of an underlying fund's expenses, the underlying fund's performance is normally below that of the index. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, the equity market tends to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Each underlying index fund seeks to track the performance of its benchmark indices, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of a fund and its benchmark index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Many of the risks of the underlying funds are associated with its investment in the large-cap segments of the stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when large-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As a result of an underlying fund's investments in securities denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. This is the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency hedged. In either event, the dollar value of an investment in a fund would be adversely affected. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk. &lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value of being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Debt Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise. Bonds with longer maturities tend to be more sensitive to this risk. Underlying fund performance also could be affected if an issuer or guarantor of a bond held by the portfolio fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Lower-quality bonds are considered speculative with respect to its issuer's ability to make timely payments or otherwise honor its obligations. In addition, prices of lower-quality bonds tend to be more volatile than those of investment-grade bonds, and may fall based on bad news about the issuer, an industry or the overall economy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Securities Lending Risk. &lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers, and other financial institutions.

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000020935_Member">The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of other Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds. The fund may also invest in unaffiliated third party mutual funds (referred to herein as unaffiliated funds and, together with Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds, the underlying funds). The fund invests in the underlying funds in accordance with its target portfolio allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The fund is managed based on the specific retirement date (target date) included in its name and assumes a retirement age of 65. The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely would stop making new investments in the fund. The fund is designed for an investor who anticipates retiring at or about the target date and plans to withdraw the value of the investor's account in the fund gradually after retirement. As described below, the adviser will continue to modify the fund's target asset allocation for 20 years beyond the target date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund's target asset allocation will be adjusted annually based on the adviser's asset allocation strategy; however, the adviser reserves the right to modify the fund's target asset allocations from time to time should circumstances warrant a change. In general, the fund's allocation to equity securities will decrease and its allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the fund approaches its target retirement date. The fund's asset allocation as of January 7, 2013 was approximately 46% equity securities, 48% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). At the stated target date, the fund's allocation will be approximately 40% equity securities, 54% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). The fund will continue to reduce its allocation to equity securities for 20 years beyond the fund's stated target date. At such time, the fund's asset allocation will remain fixed at approximately 25% equity securities, 66% fixed income securities, and 9% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition to the strategic annual adjustment of the fund's target asset allocation, the adviser may adjust the fund's underlying fund allocations within a particular asset class based on the following considerations including, but not limited to, market trends, its outlook for a given market capitalization, and the underlying funds' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular underlying fund may increase or decrease throughout the year. Within the equity asset class, the fund will have exposure to one or more "style classes". For example, the style classes include domestic large-cap equity, domestic small-cap equity, and international equity. The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000020935_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interest when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance &amp;#151; an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:+20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The portfolio seeks to remain close to the target allocations of 60% equity, 35% fixed income and 5% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) and typically does not change its target allocation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The equity allocation is further divided into three segments: 30% of assets for large-cap, 15% for small-cap and 15% for international.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The portfolio invests mainly in other Schwab Funds&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;, including index funds, which seek to track the total returns of various market indices. Index funds typically invest in the securities included in the index they are tracking, and generally give each security the same weight as the index does. The underlying funds may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend their securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. Each underlying fund focuses on a different market segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The portfolio manager monitors the portfolio's holdings and cash flow and manages them as needed in order to maintain the portfolio's target allocation. The manager may permit modest deviations from the target allocation for certain periods of time, in order to reduce transaction costs.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005918_Member">The portfolio is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The portfolio's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The portfolio is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the portfolio's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the portfolio to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the portfolio and is legally obligated to act in the portfolio's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the portfolio will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The value of your investment in the portfolio is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the portfolio purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the portfolio, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the portfolio may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the portfolio's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the portfolio's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.   &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The portfolio may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Some underlying funds seek to track the performance of various segments of the stock market, as measured by their respective indices. Each underlying fund follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of their indexing strategy, the underlying funds do not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of an underlying fund's expenses, the underlying fund's performance is normally below that of the index.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, the equity market tends to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Each underlying index fund seeks to track the performance of its benchmark indices, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of a fund and its benchmark index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Many of the risks of the underlying funds are associated with its investment in the large-cap segments of the stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when large-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; an underlying fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks, and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; an underlying fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As a result of an underlying fund's investments in securities denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. This is the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency hedged. In either event, the dollar value of an investment in a fund would be adversely affected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value of being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise. Bonds with longer maturities tend to be more sensitive to this risk. Underlying fund performance also could be affected if an issuer or guarantor of a bond held by the portfolio fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Lower-quality bonds are considered speculative with respect to its issuer's ability to make timely payments or otherwise honor its obligations. In addition, prices of lower-quality bonds tend to be more volatile than those of investment-grade bonds, and may fall based on bad news about the issuer, an industry or the overall economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers, and other financial institutions. Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The portfolio may invest directly in individual securities as well as other mutual funds or ETFs, to maintain its allocations. The portfolio's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the portfolio please see the "Portfolio details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005522_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk. &lt;/b&gt; The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.   &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk. &lt;/b&gt; Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed Income Risk. &lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments - bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance - an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt;   Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk. &lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt;   Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

Each underlying fund follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of their indexing strategy, the underlying funds do not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of an underlying fund's expenses, the underlying fund's performance is normally below that of the index.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, the equity market tends to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Each underlying index fund seeks to track the performance of its benchmark indices, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of a fund and its benchmark index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Many of the risks of the underlying funds are associated with its investment in the large-cap segments of the stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when large-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As a result of an underlying fund's investments in securities denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. This is the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency hedged. In either event, the dollar value of an investment in a fund would be adversely affected. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value of being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise. Bonds with longer maturities tend to be more sensitive to this risk. Underlying fund performance also could be affected if an issuer or guarantor of a bond held by the portfolio fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Lower-quality bonds are considered speculative with respect to its issuer's ability to make timely payments or otherwise honor its obligations. In addition, prices of lower-quality bonds tend to be more volatile than those of investment-grade bonds, and may fall based on bad news about the issuer, an industry or the overall economy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  An underlying fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers, and other financial institutions. Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The portfolio may invest directly in individual securities as well as other mutual funds or ETFs, to maintain its allocations. The portfolio's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the portfolio please see the "Portfolio details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The fund may also invest in unaffiliated third party mutual funds (referred to herein as unaffiliated funds and, together with Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds, the underlying funds). The fund invests in the underlying funds in accordance with its target portfolio allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The fund is managed based on the specific retirement date (target date) included in its name and assumes a retirement age of 65. The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely would stop making new investments in the fund. The fund is designed for an investor who anticipates retiring at or about the target date and plans to withdraw the value of the investor's account in the fund gradually after retirement. As described below, the adviser will continue to modify the fund's target asset allocation for 20 years beyond the target date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund's target asset allocation will be adjusted annually based on the adviser's asset allocation strategy; however, the adviser reserves the right to modify the fund's target asset allocations from time to time should circumstances warrant a change. In general, the fund's allocation to equity securities will decrease and its allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the fund approaches its target retirement date. The fund's asset allocation as of January 7, 2013 was approximately 68% equity securities, 29% fixed income securities, and 3% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). At the stated target date, the fund's allocation will be approximately 40% equity securities, 54% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). The fund will continue to reduce its allocation to equity securities for 20 years beyond the fund's stated target date. At such time, the fund's asset allocation will remain fixed at approximately 25% equity securities, 66% fixed income securities, and 9% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the strategic annual adjustment of the fund's target asset allocation, the adviser may adjust the fund's underlying fund allocations within a particular asset class based on the following considerations including, but not limited to, market trends, its outlook for a given market capitalization, and the underlying funds' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular underlying fund may increase or decrease throughout the year. Within the equity asset class, the fund will have exposure to one or more "style classes". For example, the style classes include domestic large-cap equity, domestic small-cap equity, and international equity. The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations.

The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk&lt;/b&gt;. Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and &lt;br/&gt;money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005523_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance &amp;#151; an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left:-15px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund&amp;#8217;s operating expenses remain the same.

These costs, which are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund&amp;#8217;s performance.

The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those time periods. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund&amp;#8217;s operating expenses remain the same. The figures are based on total annual fund operating expenses after expense reduction. The expenses would be the same whether you stayed in the fund or sold your shares at the end of each period. Your actual costs may be higher or lower.</rr:ExpenseExampleNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:PortfolioTurnoverTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005513_Member">The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or &amp;#8220;turns over&amp;#8221; its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund&amp;#8217;s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio turnover rate was 79% of the average value of its portfolio.</rr:PortfolioTurnoverTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005524_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk&lt;/b&gt;. Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005513_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its investment objective, the fund invests primarily in U.S. common stocks.&lt;/b&gt; Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in large-cap stocks of U.S. companies. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. Large-cap stocks generally are those with market capitalizations within the universe of the Russell 1000&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Index at the time of purchase by the fund. The market capitalization range of the Russell 1000&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Index was $1.35 billion to $540.21 billion, as of May 31, 2012 (the most recent index reconstitution date), and will change as market conditions change. The Russell 1000 Growth Index, the fund's comparative index, includes those Russell 1000&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Index companies with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted values. The fund invests its assets in companies it believes to have above-average growth potential. Growth may be measured by factors such as earnings or revenue. Companies with high growth potential tend to have higher than average price/earnings (P/E) or price/book (P/B) ratios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies with strong growth potential often have new products, technologies, or other opportunities, or have a strong industry or market position. The stocks of these companies are often called "growth" stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, industry and sector diversification, and volatility considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid its stock selection, the fund uses Schwab Equity Ratings&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;. Schwab Equity Ratings represent Schwab's point-of-view on the 12-month performance outlook for approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) stocks of issuers headquartered or incorporated in the United States and in certain foreign nations where companies typically locate or incorporate for operational or tax reasons. Stocks are rated using a scale of "A," "B," "C," "D" and "F." Schwab's outlook is that "A" rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and "F" rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. Generally, the fund seeks to invest in stocks that are rated "A," "B" or "C" at the time of purchase. Likewise, if a stock held by the fund is downgraded to a rating below "C," the fund will sell the stock, unless the portfolio managers believe it is necessary to continue holding the stock for purposes of diversification or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. The portfolio managers will consider the current market environment and any potential negative impact on the fund in determining when to sell a downgraded stock. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not received Schwab Equity Ratings to the extent the portfolio managers believe the purchases will help to manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index or provide potential for long-term capital growth. For more information on Schwab Equity Ratings, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. By using these instruments, the fund potentially can offset the impact on its performance of keeping some assets in cash. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). The fund also may lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help fund performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole.

Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when large-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growth Investing Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Growth stocks can be volatile. Growth companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their businesses and may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market. The prices of growth stocks are based largely on projections of the issuer's future earnings and revenues. If a company's earnings or revenues fall short of expectations, its stock price may fall dramatically. Growth stocks may also be more expensive relative to their earnings or assets compared to value or other stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.

In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund. In addition, REITs have their own expenses, and the fund will bear a proportionate share of those expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell.

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000020937_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Allocation Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The fund is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the risk that the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among the various asset classes and market segments will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliated Fund Risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The investment adviser's authority to select and substitute underlying funds from a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds may create a conflict of interest because the fees paid to it by some underlying funds are higher than the fees paid by other underlying funds. However, the portfolio manager is a fiduciary to the fund and is legally obligated to act in the fund's best interests when selecting underlying funds, without taking fees into consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk&lt;/b&gt;. Stock and bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Underlying Fund Investment Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The value of your investment in the fund is based primarily on the prices of the underlying funds that the fund purchases. In turn, the price of each underlying fund is based on the value of its securities. Before investing in the fund, investors should assess the risks associated with the underlying funds in which the fund may invest and the types of investments made by those underlying funds. These risks include any combination of the risks described below, although the fund's exposure to a particular risk will be proportionate to the fund's overall asset allocation and underlying fund allocation.&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An investment in an underlying fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund may experience losses with respect to its investment in an underlying fund. Further, there is no guarantee that an underlying fund will be able to achieve its objective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Generally, the underlying funds are actively managed mutual funds. Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser (or sub-adviser(s)) will make poor security selections. An underlying fund's adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed Income Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Interest rates rise and fall over time, which will affect an underlying fund's yield and share price. The credit quality of a portfolio investment could also cause an underlying fund's share price to fall. An underlying fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment or the counterparty to a derivatives contract fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Fixed income securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause an underlying fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund's yield or share price. Below investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve greater credit risk, are more volatile, involve greater risk of price declines and may be more susceptible to economic downturns than investment-grade securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-, Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stocks of different market capitalizations tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. During a period when stocks of a particular market capitalization fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or stocks of another capitalization range, for instance &amp;#8212; an underlying fund's large-, mid- or small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although an underlying money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 net asset value, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. In addition, a money market fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When a fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; An underlying fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain underlying fund transactions, such as derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose a fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of an underlying fund's portfolio securities, which means even a small amount of leverage can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 5px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Certain of the underlying funds may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If they do, their portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower the underlying fund's performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund may invest a portion of its assets directly in equity and fixed income securities, ETFs, cash equivalents, including money market securities, and futures. The fund's direct investment in these securities is subject to the same or similar risks as an underlying fund's investment in the same security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You may experience losses in the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to achieve its objective or provide adequate income at and through your retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund and the underlying funds please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000020937_Member">The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of other Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds. The fund may also invest in unaffiliated third party mutual funds (referred to herein as unaffiliated funds and, together with Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds, the underlying funds). The fund invests in the underlying funds in accordance with its target portfolio allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The fund is managed based on the specific retirement date (target date) included in its name and assumes a retirement age of 65. The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely would stop making new investments in the fund. The fund is designed for an investor who anticipates retiring at or about the target date and plans to withdraw the value of the investor's account in the fund gradually after retirement. As described below, the adviser will continue to modify the fund's target asset allocation for 20 years beyond the target date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund's target asset allocation will be adjusted annually based on the adviser's asset allocation strategy; however, the adviser reserves the right to modify the fund's target asset allocations from time to time should circumstances warrant a change. In general, the fund's allocation to equity securities will decrease and its allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the fund approaches its target retirement date. The fund's asset allocation as of January 7, 2013 was approximately 83% equity securities, 15% fixed income securities, and 2% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). At the stated target date, the fund's allocation will be approximately 40% equity securities, 54% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). The fund will continue to reduce its allocation to equity securities for 20 years beyond the fund's stated target date. At such time, the fund's asset allocation will remain fixed at approximately 25% equity securities, 66% fixed income securities, and 9% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition to the strategic annual adjustment of the fund's target asset allocation, the adviser may adjust the fund's underlying fund allocations within a particular asset class based on the following considerations including, but not limited to, market trends, its outlook for a given market capitalization, and the underlying funds' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular underlying fund may increase or decrease throughout the year. Within the equity asset class, the fund will have exposure to one or more "style classes". For example, the style classes include domestic large-cap equity, domestic small-cap equity, and international equity. The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005524_Member">The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of other Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds. The fund may also invest in unaffiliated third party mutual funds (referred to herein as unaffiliated funds and, together with Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds, the underlying funds). The fund invests in the underlying funds in accordance with its target portfolio allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The fund is managed based on the specific retirement date (target date) included in its name and assumes a retirement age of 65. The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely would stop making new investments in the fund. The fund is designed for an investor who anticipates retiring at or about the target date and plans to withdraw the value of the investor's account in the fund gradually after retirement. As described below, the adviser will continue to modify the fund's target asset allocation for 20 years beyond the target date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund's target asset allocation will be adjusted annually based on the adviser's asset allocation strategy; however, the adviser reserves the right to modify the fund's target asset allocations from time to time should circumstances warrant a change. In general, the fund's allocation to equity securities will decrease and its allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the fund approaches its target retirement date. The fund's asset allocation as of January 7, 2013 was approximately 88% equity securities, 10% fixed income securities, and 2% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). At the stated target date, the fund's allocation will be approximately 40% equity securities, 54% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). The fund will continue to reduce its allocation to equity securities for 20 years beyond the fund's stated target date. At such time, the fund's asset allocation will remain fixed at approximately 25% equity securities, 66% fixed income securities, and 9% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition to the strategic annual adjustment of the fund's target asset allocation, the adviser may adjust the fund's underlying fund allocations within a particular asset class based on the following considerations including, but not limited to, market trends, its outlook for a given market capitalization, and the underlying funds' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular underlying fund may increase or decrease throughout the year. Within the equity asset class, the fund will have exposure to one or more "style classes". For example, the style classes include domestic large-cap equity, domestic small-cap equity, and international equity. The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005514_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its investment objective, the fund invests primarily in U.S. stocks. &lt;/b&gt;Under normal circumstances, the fund pursues its goal by investing at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of U.S. companies. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund expects to hold the common stocks of U.S. companies that have market capitalizations of approximately $500 million or more. The fund seeks to assemble a portfolio with long-term performance that will exceed that of the S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, industry and sector diversification, and volatility considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund approaches risk management from the perspective of its comparative index, the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index. The S&amp;amp;P 500 Index includes the common stocks of 500 leading U.S. publicly-traded companies from a broad range of industries. The portfolio managers seek to keep the fund's volatility similar to that of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To aid its stock selection, the fund uses Schwab Equity Ratings&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;. Schwab Equity Ratings represent Schwab's point-of-view on the 12-month performance outlook for approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) stocks of issuers headquartered or incorporated in the United States and in certain foreign nations where companies typically locate or incorporate for operational or tax reasons. Stocks are rated using a scale of "A," "B," "C," "D" and "F." Schwab's outlook is that "A" rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and "F" rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. Generally, the fund seeks to invest in stocks that are rated "A" or "B" at the time of purchase, but the fund may purchase "C"-rated stocks for purposes of diversification or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. Likewise, if a stock held by the fund is downgraded to a rating below "C", the fund will sell the stock unless the portfolio managers believe it is necessary to continue holding the stock for purposes of diversification or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. The portfolio managers will consider the current market environment and any potential negative impact on the fund in determining when to sell a downgraded stock. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not received Schwab Equity Ratings to the extent the portfolio managers believe the purchases will help to manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio or provide potential for long-term capital growth. For more information on Schwab Equity Ratings, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. By using these instruments, the fund potentially can offset the impact on its performance of keeping some assets in cash. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). The fund also may lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help fund performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005514_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment adviser makes investment decisions for the fund using a strategy based largely on historical information. There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Large- and Mid-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Both large- and mid-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. However, stocks of mid-cap companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies. During a period when large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; the fund's large- and mid-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Fund ("ETF") Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When the fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund. In addition, REITs have their own expenses, and the fund will bear a proportionate share of those expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The fund seeks to provide current income from dividends that are eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income. The fund also seeks to provide capital appreciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, industry and sector diversification, and volatility considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To aid its stock selection, the fund uses Schwab Equity Ratings&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;. Schwab Equity Ratings represent Schwab's point-of-view on the 12-month performance outlook for approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) stocks of issuers headquartered or incorporated in the United States and in certain foreign nations where companies typically locate or incorporate for operational or tax reasons. Stocks are rated using a scale of "A," "B," "C," "D" and "F." Schwab's outlook is that "A" rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and "F" rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund's initial selection universe typically consists of the 1,500 largest U.S. publicly-traded companies in terms of market capitalization. These companies tend to be large- to mid-cap companies. From this list, the fund's portfolio managers seek to select stocks that pay dividends and that have been rated "A" or "B" by Schwab Equity Ratings. The fund may purchase "C"-rated stocks for purposes of diversification or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. Likewise, if a stock held by the fund is downgraded to a rating below "C," the fund will sell the stock unless the portfolio managers believe it is necessary to continue holding the stock for purposes of diversification or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. The portfolio managers will consider the current market environment and any potential negative impact on the fund in determining when to sell a downgraded stock. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not received Schwab Equity Ratings to the extent the portfolio managers believe the purchases will help to manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio or provide potential for capital appreciation. The portfolio managers then construct a diversified portfolio that seeks to provide a dividend yield that exceeds that of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index while seeking to maintain a lower volatility than that of the Index. For more information about Schwab Equity Ratings, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may also invest in other equity investments, including convertible securities. Convertible securities can be converted into or exchanged for common stocks, preferred stocks or other securities. Convertible securities and preferred stocks provide an opportunity for equity participation, with the potential for a higher dividend or interest yield and lower price volatility compared to common stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. By using these instruments, the fund potentially can offset the impact on its performance of keeping some assets in cash. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). The fund also may lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help fund performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment adviser makes investment decisions for the fund using a strategy based largely on historical information. There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks, and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; large-cap and mid-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Fund ("ETF") Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When the fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund.

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005917_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its goal, the portfolio maintains a defined asset allocation. &lt;/b&gt;The portfolio's target allocation includes stock, bond and cash investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio's allocation focuses on stock investments, while including some bonds and cash investments in seeking to reduce the portfolio's volatility. The portfolio seeks to remain close to the target allocations of 80% equity, 15% fixed income and 5% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) and typically does not change its target allocation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equity allocation is further divided into three segments: 40% of assets for large-cap, 20% for small-cap and 20% for international.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio invests mainly in other Schwab Funds&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;, including index funds, which seek to track the total returns of various market indices. Index funds typically invest in the securities included in the index they are tracking, and generally give each security the same weight as the index does. The underlying funds may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend their securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. Each underlying fund focuses on a different market segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio manager monitors the portfolio's holdings and cash flow and manages them as needed in order to maintain the portfolio's target allocation. The manager may permit modest deviations from the target allocation for certain periods of time, in order to reduce transaction costs.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment adviser makes investment decisions for the fund using a strategy based largely on historical information. There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund primarily invests in dividend paying stocks. As a result, fund performance will correlate directly with the performance of the dividend paying stock segment of the stock market, and the fund may underperform funds that do not limit their investments to dividend paying stocks. If stocks held by the fund reduce or stop paying dividends, the fund's ability to generate income may be affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large- and Mid-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Both large- and mid-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. However, stocks of mid-cap companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies. During a period when large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's large- and mid-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Convertible Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Convertible securities generally are debt obligations that pay income, but which may convert into common or preferred stock under certain circumstances. These investments, which are often issued by smaller or less established companies, are subject to the equity risks described above, but they also are subject to fixed income risks. For example, an issuer may fail to pay interest or dividends, and prices of convertible securities generally will fall when interest rates rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Fund ("ETF") Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When the fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund. In addition, REITs have their own expenses, and the fund will bear a proportionate share of those expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell.

These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries.

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000022039_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its investment objective, the fund invests primarily in the stocks of publicly traded companies located in developed countries excluding the United States. &lt;/b&gt;The fund considers developed countries to include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Though the fund invests primarily in securities issued by companies located in developed countries, it may also invest in securities issued by companies located in emerging markets. The fund considers any country that is not a developed country to be an emerging market country.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund typically invests a majority of its assets in the stocks of large-cap and mid-cap companies, but may invest a portion of its assets in small-cap companies. In addition, the portfolio managers seek to allocate the fund's investments across different countries and geographic regions in an effort to manage the economic and socio-political risks associated with investing in a single country or limited number of countries. The fund seeks to assemble a portfolio with long-term performance that will exceed that of the MSCI EAFE Index. The MSCI EAFE Index includes over 1,000 securities listed on the stock exchanges of certain developed market countries in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Far East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, country and sector diversification, and volatility considerations. The fund generally does not intend to hedge its exposure to foreign currencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To aid its stock selection, the fund uses Charles Schwab and Co., Inc.'s ("Schwab's") proprietary international stock research. This research ranks stocks of publicly traded companies located in the countries in the MSCI EAFE Index plus publicly traded stocks of companies located in certain additional countries not included in the Index. The stocks are ranked based on factors that Schwab believes to be indicative of stocks' performance potential. The fund may also use additional research as a component of its overall stock selection process. This research may incorporate the analysis of factors including, but not limited to, valuation, balance sheet strength, future earnings power and trading activity to identify companies expected to outperform the broader equity market. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not been ranked by Schwab research. For more information on Schwab's proprietary international stock research, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. By using these instruments, the fund potentially can offset the impact on its performance of keeping some assets in cash. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). The fund also may lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help fund performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund&amp;#8217;s performance.

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005517_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its investment objective, the fund will establish long and short positions in equity securities issued by U.S. companies.&lt;/b&gt; Under normal circumstances it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities issued by U.S. companies; typically, the actual percentage will be higher. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund typically purchases or sells short stocks of companies that have market capitalizations of $1 billion or more at the time the stock is purchased or sold short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, industry and sector diversification, and volatility considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To aid its stock selection, the fund uses Schwab Equity Ratings&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;. Schwab Equity Ratings represent Schwab's point-of-view on the 12-month performance outlook for approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) stocks of issuers headquartered or incorporated in the United States and in certain foreign nations where companies typically locate or incorporate for operational or tax reasons. Stocks are rated using a scale of "A," "B," "C," "D" and "F." Schwab's outlook is that "A" rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and "F" rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. In general, the fund selects its long positions from stocks that are rated "A" or "B" at the time of purchase and selects its short positions from stocks that are rated "D" or "F" at the time of purchase. The fund may purchase or sell short a "C"-rated stock for purposes of diversification or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not received Schwab Equity Ratings to the extent the portfolio managers believe the purchases will help to manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio or provide potential for long-term capital appreciation. For more information about Schwab Equity Ratings, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When the fund takes a long position, it purchases a stock outright. When the fund takes a short position, it sells a stock that it has borrowed. To complete, or close out, the short sale transaction, the fund buys the same stock in the market and returns it to the lender. The fund makes money if the market price of the stock goes down after the short sale. Conversely, if the price of the stock goes up after the short sale, the fund will lose money because it will have to pay more to replace the borrowed stock than it received when it sold the stock short. Short positions may be used to hedge against the volatility of the long portion of the overall portfolio and/or to garner returns from declines in securities prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund also may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of real estate investment trusts ("REITs").&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <rr:RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005517_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal risks &lt;/b&gt;</rr:RiskHeading>
  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005517_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment adviser makes investment decisions for the fund using a strategy based largely on historical information. There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's long positions could decline in value at the same time that the value of the stocks sold short increase, thereby increasing the fund's overall potential for loss. The fund's short sales may result in a loss if the prices of the borrowed securities rise and it costs more to replace the borrowed securities. In contrast to the fund's long positions, the potential loss on the fund's short positions is unlimited. In addition, the lender of the borrowed securities may require the fund to return the securities on short notice, which may require the fund to purchase the borrowed securities at an unfavorable price, and could result in a loss to the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time. &lt;b&gt;The fund's use of short selling may reduce the risk of general equity market volatility but cannot completely eliminate the risk. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Large- and Mid-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Both large- and mid-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. However, stocks of mid-cap companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies. During a period when large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; the fund's large- and mid-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Short Sales Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Short sales are transactions in which the fund sells a security it does not own. To complete a short sale, the fund must borrow the security to deliver to the buyer. The fund is then obligated to replace the borrowed security by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of replacement. This price may be more or less than the price at which the security was sold by the fund and the fund will incur a loss if the price of the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the time the fund replaces the borrowed security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Fund ("ETF") Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When the fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund. In addition, REITs have their own expenses, and the fund will bear a proportionate share of those expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

It is the fund's policy that under normal circumstances it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in these securities; typically, the actual percentage will be higher. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will concentrate its investments in securities of companies in the financial services sector. The fund generally invests in U.S. companies and may invest in companies of all sizes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, industry diversification, and volatility considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To aid its stock selection, the fund uses Schwab Equity Ratings&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;. Schwab Equity Ratings represent Schwab's point-of-view on the 12-month performance outlook for approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) stocks of issuers headquartered or incorporated in the United States and in certain foreign nations where companies typically locate or incorporate for operational or tax reasons. Stocks are rated using a scale of "A," "B," "C," "D" and "F." Schwab's outlook is that "A" rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and "F" rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. Generally, the fund seeks to invest in stocks that are rated "A" or "B" at the time of purchase, but the fund may purchase "C"-rated stocks to broaden exposure among industries represented in the portfolio or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. Likewise, if a stock held by the fund is downgraded to a rating below "C", the fund will sell the stock unless the portfolio managers believe it is necessary to continue holding the stock for purposes of maintaining this exposure or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. The portfolio managers will consider the current market environment and any potential negative impact on the fund in determining when to sell a downgraded stock. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not received Schwab Equity Ratings to the extent the portfolio managers believe the purchases will help to manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio or provide potential for long-term capital growth. For more information about Schwab Equity Ratings, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. By using these instruments, the fund potentially can offset the impact on its performance of keeping some assets in cash. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). The fund also may lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help fund performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

("MSCI") and has been licensed for use by the Schwab International Index Fund. The Schwab International Index Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by MSCI and MSCI bears no liability with respect to the fund. The Statement of Additional Information contains a more detailed description of the limited relationship MSCI has with the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the fund's policy that under normal circumstances it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in these stocks; typically, the actual percentage is considerably higher. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund generally gives the same weight to a given stock as the index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the index in anticipation of their removal from the index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the index in anticipation of their addition to the index. The fund does not hedge its exposure to foreign currencies. However, the fund may use forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for the portfolio securities purchased or sold, but awaiting settlement. These transactions establish a rate of exchange that can be expected to be received upon settlement of the securities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MSCI EAFE Index includes stocks from Europe, Australasia and the Far East, and as of December 31, 2012, it consisted of the following 22 developed market country indices: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund potentially can offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. In addition, any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that its comparative index is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005914_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund primarily follows the performance of a mix of international large-cap stocks, as measured by the index. It follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Geographic Risk. &lt;/b&gt;To the extent the fund's investments in a single country or a limited number of countries represent a higher percentage of the fund's assets, the fund assumes the risk that economic, political and social conditions in those countries will have a significant impact on its investment performance and it may be subject to increased price volatility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when these stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector, country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector, country or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005519_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its goal, the fund primarily invests in equity securities issued by companies in the health care sector.&lt;/b&gt; The health care sector may include, for example, drug and biotechnology companies, health care facilities operations, medical product manufacturers and suppliers, medical providers and medical services firms. It is the fund's policy that under normal circumstances it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in these securities; typically, the actual percentage will be higher. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will concentrate its investments in securities of companies in the health care sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The fund primarily invests in U.S. companies, but may invest up to 25% of its net assets in the stocks of publicly traded companies located in countries other than the United States. The fund's international investments will primarily be in stocks issued by companies located in developed countries; however, it may also invest in stocks issued by companies located in emerging markets. The fund considers developed countries to include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The fund considers any country that is not a developed country to be an emerging market country. The fund generally does not intend to hedge its exposure to foreign currencies. The fund may invest in companies of all sizes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The fund uses a portfolio optimization process to assist in constructing the portfolio. The portfolio managers seek to use the portfolio optimization process to build a portfolio they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return, subject to parameters such as the number of stocks desired in the portfolio, the level of portfolio turnover, industry diversification, and volatility considerations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  To aid its U.S. stock selection, the fund uses Schwab Equity Ratings&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;. Schwab Equity Ratings represent Schwab's point-of-view on the 12-month performance outlook for approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) stocks of issuers headquartered or incorporated in the United States and in certain foreign nations where companies typically locate or incorporate for operational or tax reasons. Stocks are rated using a scale of "A," "B," "C," "D" and "F." Schwab's outlook is that "A" rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and "F" rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. Generally, the fund seeks to invest in stocks that are rated "A" or "B" at the time of purchase, but the fund may purchase "C"-rated stocks to broaden exposure among industries represented in the portfolio or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. Likewise, if a stock held by the fund is downgraded to a rating below "C", the fund will sell the stock unless the portfolio managers believe it is necessary to continue holding the stock for purposes of maintaining this exposure or to help manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio relative to the fund's comparative index. The portfolio managers will consider the current market environment and any potential negative impact on the fund in determining when to sell a downgraded stock. In addition, the fund may purchase certain stocks that have not received Schwab Equity Ratings to the extent the portfolio managers believe the purchases will help to manage the volatility of the fund's portfolio or provide potential for long-term capital growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  To aid its international stock selection, the fund uses Schwab's proprietary international stock research. This research ranks stocks, including stocks of certain real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), of publicly traded companies located in the countries in the MSCI EAFE Index plus stocks of publicly traded companies located in additional countries not included in the MSCI EAFE Index. In addition, the fund may purchase stocks that have not been ranked by Schwab's research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  For more information on Schwab Equity Ratings and Schwab's proprietary international stock research, please see the "More about Schwab's research" section in the prospectus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, primarily to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial instrument at a specified price at a specific future time. By using these instruments, the fund potentially can offset the impact on its performance of keeping some assets in cash. The fund may invest in exchange traded funds and stocks of REITs. The fund also may lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help fund performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and may increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005518_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment adviser makes investment decisions for the fund using a strategy based largely on historical information. There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Because the fund's investments are concentrated in issuers doing business in the same sector, the companies in which the fund invests will be affected by many of the same factors, such as legislative or regulatory changes, intense competition for market share and other competitive challenges. In addition, stocks of financial services companies may underperform other segments of the equity market or stock market as a whole and are likely to have above-average volatility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Fund ("ETF") Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When the fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund. In addition, REITs have their own expenses, and the fund will bear a proportionate share of those expenses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005519_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment adviser makes investment decisions for the fund using a strategy based largely on historical information. There is no guarantee that a strategy based on historical information will produce the desired results in the future. In addition, the portfolio optimization process used by the fund to assist in constructing the fund's portfolio does not assure successful investment. Securities selected with the assistance of the process may be negatively impacted by factors or events not foreseen in developing the process. As a result, the fund may have a lower return than if it were managed using another process or strategy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Because the fund's investments are concentrated in issuers doing business in the same sector, the companies in which the fund invests will be affected by many of the same factors, such as legislative or regulatory changes, intense competition for market share and other competitive challenges. In addition, stocks of health care companies may underperform other segments of the equity market or stock market as a whole and are likely to have above-average volatility.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Fund ("ETF") Risk.&lt;/b&gt; When the fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;REITs Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in REITs will be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. REITs are also subject to certain additional risks, for example, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills and cash flows, and may have their investments in relatively few properties, a small geographic area or a single property type. Failure of a company to qualify as a REIT under federal tax law may have adverse consequences on the fund. In addition, REITs have their own expenses, and the fund will bear a proportionate share of those expenses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The fund generally gives the same weight to a given stock as the index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund&amp;#146;s weighting of a stock to be more or less than the index&amp;#146;s weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the index in anticipation of their removal from the index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the index in anticipation of their addition to the index.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The S&amp;amp;P 500 Index includes the stocks of 500 leading U.S. publicly-traded companies from a broad range of industries. Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#146;s, the company that maintains the index, uses a variety of measures to determine which stocks are listed in the index. Each stock is represented in the index in proportion to its total market value.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund potentially can offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. In addition, any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that its comparative index is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005911_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&amp;#146;s principal risks include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund primarily follows the large-cap portion of the U.S. stock market, as measured by the index. It follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund&amp;#146;s expenses, the fund&amp;#146;s performance may be below that of the index.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called &amp;#147;tracking error.&amp;#148; Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be  significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities&amp;#146; weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although the S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;sup style="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; Index encompasses stocks from many different sectors of the economy, its performance primarily reflects that of large-cap stocks, which tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. As a result, during a period when these stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds or mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; the fund&amp;#146;s large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund&amp;#146;s or the index&amp;#146;s portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund&amp;#146;s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the &amp;#147;Fund details&amp;#148; section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

Securities are grouped in order of decreasing score and each company receives a weight based on the total weights of the companies within the Russell Index. Companies are split at the 87.5% point based on fundamental weights. Companies above this breakpoint make up the Index. The Index uses a partial quarterly reconstitution methodology in which the Index is split into four equal segments at the annual reconstitution and each segment is then rebalanced on a rolling quarterly basis. The Index is compiled and calculated by Russell Investments in conjunction with Research Affiliates LLC, and the method of calculating the components of the Index is subject to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the fund's policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 90% of its net assets in stocks included in the Index. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will generally give the same weight to a given stock as the Index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the Index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the Index in anticipation of their removal from the Index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the Index in anticipation of their addition to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund uses an "indexing" investment approach, which attempts to replicate, before expenses, the performance of the Index by purchasing a basket of securities that compose the Index. Using this approach, the investment adviser seeks a correlation, over time, of 0.95 or better between the fund's performance and the performance of the Index; a figure of 1.00 would represent perfect correlation. However, it is possible that the investment adviser may determine to utilize instead a "sampling" methodology in seeking to achieve the fund's objective. Sampling means that the investment adviser uses quantitative analysis to select stocks from the Index universe to obtain a representative sample of stocks that resembles the Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics. In certain circumstances it may not be possible or practicable for the fund to invest in all of the stocks comprising the Index or in proportion to their weightings in the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no guarantee that the performance of the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation with that of the Index. A number of factors may affect the fund's ability to achieve a high correlation with its Index, including the degree to which the fund utilizes a sampling technique. The correlation between the performance of the fund and its Index may also diverge due to transaction costs, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances, and differences between the fund's portfolio and the Index resulting from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the fund but not to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many index funds, the fund also may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the Index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund can gain market exposure and potentially offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. Any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that the Index the fund is designed to track is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large-cap stocks, and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately larger impact on the fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sampling Index Tracking Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent the fund uses a sampling method, the fund will not fully replicate its comparative index and may hold securities not included in the index. As a result, the fund will be subject to the risk that the investment adviser's investment management strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. If the fund utilizes a sampling approach, it may not track the return of the index as well as it would if the fund purchased all of the securities in the index. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000016768_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its goal, the fund primarily invests in stocks that are included in the Russell Fundamental Developed ex-U.S. Large Company Index&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Index ownership &amp;#151; "Russell Fundamental Developed ex-U.S. Large Company Index" is a joint trademark of Russell Investments ("Russell") and Research Affiliates LLC ("RA") and is used by the fund under license. "Research Affiliates" and "Fundamental Index" are trademarks of RA. Subject to RA's intellectual property rights in certain content, Russell is the owner of all copyrights related to the Russell Fundamental Indexes. Russell is the owner of the trademarks and copyrights related to the Russell Indexes. Schwab Fundamental International Large Company Index Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Russell or RA, and Russell and RA do not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in shares of the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;(the "Index").&lt;/b&gt; The Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores ("scores"), which are created using as the universe the companies in the Russell Developed ex-U.S. Index (the "Russell Index"). Securities are grouped in order of decreasing score and each company receives a weight based on the total weights of the companies within the Russell Index. Companies are split at the 87.5% point based on fundamental weights. Companies above this breakpoint make up the Index. The Index uses a partial quarterly reconstitution methodology in which the Index is split into four equal segments at the annual reconstitution and each segment is then rebalanced on a rolling quarterly basis. The Index is compiled and calculated by Russell Investments in conjunction with Research Affiliates LLC, and the method of calculating the components of the Index is subject to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is the fund's policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 90% of its net assets in stocks included in the Index. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will generally give the same weight to a given stock as the Index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the Index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the Index in anticipation of their removal from the Index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the Index in anticipation of their addition to the Index. The fund does not hedge its exposure to foreign currencies. However, the fund may use forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for the portfolio securities purchased or sold, but awaiting settlement. These transactions establish a rate of exchange that can be expected to be received upon settlement of the securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses an "indexing" investment approach, which attempts to replicate, before expenses, the performance of the Index by purchasing a basket of securities that compose the Index. Using this approach, the investment adviser seeks a correlation, over time, of 0.95 or better between the fund's performance and the performance of the Index; a figure of 1.00 would represent perfect correlation. However, it is possible that the investment adviser may determine to utilize instead a "sampling" methodology in seeking to achieve the fund's objective. Sampling means that the investment adviser uses quantitative analysis to select stocks from the Index universe to obtain a representative sample of stocks that resembles the Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics. In certain circumstances it may not be possible or practicable for the fund to invest in all of the stocks comprising the Index or in proportion to their weightings in the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There can be no guarantee that the performance of the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation with that of the Index. A number of factors may affect the fund's ability to achieve a high correlation with its Index, including the degree to which the fund utilizes a sampling technique. The correlation between the performance of the fund and its Index may also diverge due to transaction costs, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances, and differences between the fund's portfolio and the Index resulting from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the fund but not to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Like many index funds, the fund also may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the Index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund can gain market exposure and potentially offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. Any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses. In addition, the fund may invest in exchange-traded funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that the Index the fund is designed to track is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

As a result, during a period when these stocks fall behind other types of investments - bonds or small company stocks, for instance - the fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk. &lt;/b&gt;As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so.

These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested.

When the fund invests in an ETF, in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. Therefore, it may be more costly to own an ETF than to own the underlying securities directly. In addition, while the risks of owning shares of an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities the ETF is designed to track, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment managers attempt to reduce the impact of the performance of any given investment style by investing in both value and growth style stocks. But whenever value stocks fall out of favor with investors, they may underperform growth stocks, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid- and Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, mid- and small-cap stocks have been riskier than large-cap stocks, and may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Mid- and small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small- or mid-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212;  bonds or large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212;  the fund's mid- and small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As with all actively managed funds, the strategies of the fund's managers &amp;#8212;  its investment adviser and investment managers &amp;#8212;  may not achieve their desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-Manager Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although CSIM monitors and seeks to coordinate the overall management of the fund, each investment manager makes investment decisions independently, and it is possible that the investment styles of the investment managers may not complement one another. As a result, the fund's exposure to a given stock, industry or investment style could unintentionally be smaller or larger than if the fund had a single manager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000019900_Member">&lt;b&gt;To pursue its goal, the fund primarily invests in stocks that are included in the Russell Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Index ownership &amp;#8212; "Russell Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index" is a joint trademark of Russell Investments ("Russell") and Research Affiliates LLC ("RA") and is used by the fund under license. "Research Affiliates" and "Fundamental Index" are trademarks of RA. Subject to RA's intellectual property rights in certain content, Russell is the owner of all copyrights related to the Russell Fundamental Indexes. Russell is the owner of the trademarks and copyrights related to the Russell Indexes. Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Russell or RA, and Russell and RA do not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in shares of the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;(the "Index").&lt;/b&gt; The Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores ("scores"), which are created using as the universe the companies in the Russell Emerging Markets Index (the "Russell Index"). Securities are grouped in order of decreasing score and each company receives a weight based on the total weights of the companies within the Russell Index. Companies are split at the 87.5% point based on fundamental weights. Companies above this breakpoint make up the Index. The Index uses a partial quarterly reconstitution methodology in which the Index is split into four equal segments at the annual reconstitution and each segment is then rebalanced on a rolling quarterly basis. The Index is compiled and calculated by Russell Investments in conjunction with Research Affiliates LLC, and the method of calculating the components of the Index is subject to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is the fund's policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in stocks included in the Index, including depositary receipts representing securities of the Index; which may be in the form of American Depositary receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary receipts ("GDRs") and European Depositary receipts ("EDRs"). The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will generally give the same weight to a given stock as the Index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the Index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the Index in anticipation of their removal from the Index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the Index in anticipation of their addition to the Index. The fund does not hedge its exposure to foreign currencies. However, the fund may use forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for the portfolio securities purchased or sold, but awaiting settlement. These transactions establish a rate of exchange that can be expected to be received upon settlement of the securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses an "indexing" investment approach, which attempts to replicate, before expenses, the performance of the Index by purchasing a basket of securities that compose the Index. Using this approach, the investment adviser seeks a correlation, over time, of 0.95 or better between the fund's performance and the performance of the Index; a figure of 1.00 would represent perfect correlation. However, it is possible that the investment adviser may determine to utilize instead a "sampling" methodology in seeking to achieve the fund's objective. Sampling means that the investment adviser uses quantitative analysis to select stocks from the Index universe to obtain a representative sample of stocks that resembles the Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics. In certain circumstances it may not be possible or practicable for the fund to invest in all of the stocks comprising the Index or in proportion to their weightings in the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There can be no guarantee that the performance of the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation with that of the Index. A number of factors may affect the fund's ability to achieve a high correlation with its Index, including the degree to which the fund utilizes a sampling technique. The correlation between the performance of the fund and its Index may also diverge due to transaction costs, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances, and differences between the fund's portfolio and the Index resulting from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the fund but not to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Like many index funds, the fund also may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the Index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund can gain market exposure and potentially offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. Any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses. In addition, the fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that the Index the fund is designed to track is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000019900_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Stock markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund invests in companies outside the U.S. stock market, as measured by the index. It follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-Cap Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Certain of the risks of this fund are associated with its investments in the large-cap segments of a stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. As a result, during a period when these stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk. &lt;/b&gt;As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector, country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector, country or asset class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets. Foreign securities also include ADRs, GDRs, and EDRs, which are receipts issued by U.S. and foreign banks that represent shares of foreign-based corporations. Investment in ADRs, GDRs and EDRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market and GDRs, many of which are issued by companies in emerging markets, may be more volatile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately larger impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk. &lt;/b&gt;A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sampling Index Tracking Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent the fund uses a sampling method, the fund will not fully replicate its comparative index and may hold securities not included in the index. As a result, the fund will be subject to the risk that the investment adviser's investment management strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. If the fund utilizes a sampling approach, it may not track the return of the index as well as it would if the fund purchased all of the securities in the index. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds ("ETFs") Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund may purchase shares of ETFs to gain exposure to a particular portion of the market while awaiting an opportunity to purchase securities directly. When the fund invests in an ETF, in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. Therefore, it may be more costly to own an ETF than to own the underlying securities directly. In addition, while the risks of owning shares of an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities the ETF is designed to track, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio securities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

Russell is the owner of the trademarks and copyrights related to the Russell Indexes. Schwab Fundamental US Small Company Index Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Russell or RA, and Russell and RA do not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in shares of the fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;(the "Index").&lt;/b&gt; The Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores ("scores"), which are created using as the universe the companies in the Russell 3000&lt;sup style="POSITION: relative; BOTTOM: 0.8ex; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Index (the "Russell Index"). Securities are grouped in order of decreasing score and each company receives a weight based on the total weights of the companies within the Russell Index. Companies are split at the 87.5% point based on fundamental weights. Companies below this breakpoint make up the Index. The Index uses a partial quarterly reconstitution methodology in which the Index is split into four equal segments at the annual reconstitution and each segment is then rebalanced on a rolling quarterly basis. The Index is compiled and calculated by Russell Investments in conjunction with Research Affiliates LLC, and the method of calculating the components of the Index is subject to change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    It is the fund's policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 90% of its net assets in stocks included in the Index. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will generally give the same weight to a given stock as the Index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the Index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the Index in anticipation of their removal from the Index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the Index in anticipation of their addition to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund uses an "indexing" investment approach, which attempts to replicate, before expenses, the performance of the Index by purchasing a basket of securities that compose the Index. Using this approach, the investment adviser seeks a correlation, over time, of 0.95 or better between the fund's performance and the performance of the Index; a figure of 1.00 would represent perfect correlation. However, it is possible that the investment adviser may determine to utilize instead a "sampling" methodology in seeking to achieve the fund's objective. Sampling means that the investment adviser uses quantitative analysis to select stocks from the Index universe to obtain a representative sample of stocks that resembles the Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics. In certain circumstances it may not be possible or practicable for the fund to invest in all of the stocks comprising the Index or in proportion to their weightings in the Index. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no guarantee that the performance of the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation with that of the Index. A number of factors may affect the fund's ability to achieve a high correlation with its Index, including the degree to which the fund utilizes a sampling technique. The correlation between the performance of the fund and its Index may also diverge due to transaction costs, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances, and differences between the fund's portfolio and the Index resulting from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the fund but not to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Like many index funds, the fund also may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the Index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund can gain market exposure and potentially offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. Any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that the Index the fund is designed to track is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000016766_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Stock markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund invests in companies within the U.S. stock market, as measured by the index. It follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although the index encompasses stocks from many different sectors of the economy, its performance primarily reflects that of large company stocks, which tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. As a result, during a period when these stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; bonds or small company stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's large-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sampling Index Tracking Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent the fund uses a sampling method, the fund will not fully replicate its comparative index and may hold securities not included in the index. As a result, the fund will be subject to the risk that the investment adviser's investment management strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. If the fund utilizes a sampling approach, it may not track the return of the index as well as it would if the fund purchased all of the securities in the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund generally gives the same weight to a given stock as the index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the index in anticipation of their removal from the index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the index in anticipation of their addition to the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#8480;&lt;/sup&gt; includes all publicly traded stocks of companies headquartered in the United States for which pricing information is readily available &amp;#151; currently more than 3,600 stocks. The index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that reflects the shares of securities actually available to investors in the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because it may not be possible or practical to purchase all of the stocks included in the index, the investment adviser seeks to track the total return of the index by using statistical sampling techniques. These techniques involve investing in a limited number of index securities which, when taken together, are expected to perform similarly to the index as a whole. These techniques are based on a variety of factors, including capitalization, performance attributes, dividend yield, price/earnings ratio, risk factors, industry factors and other characteristics. The fund generally expects that its portfolio will include the largest 2,000 to 2,800 U.S. stocks (measured by the float-adjusted market capitalization), and that its industry weightings, dividend yield and price/earnings ratio will be similar to those of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund potentially can offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. In addition, any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that its comparative index is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005913_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund follows the U.S. stock market, as measured by the index. It follows this market during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sampling Index Tracking Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund does not fully replicate its comparative index and may hold securities not included in the index. As a result, the fund is subject to the risk that the investment adviser's investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. Because the fund utilizes a sampling approach, it may not track the return of the index as well as it would if the fund purchased all of the securities in the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large- and Mid-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Many of the risks of this fund are associated with its investment in the large- and mid-cap segments of the U.S. stock market. Both large- and mid-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. However, stocks of mid-cap companies tend to be more volatile than those of large-cap companies because mid-cap companies tend to be more susceptible to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies. During a period when large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; bonds, for instance &amp;#151; the fund's large- and mid-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. Stock prices of smaller companies may be based in substantial part on future expectations rather than current achievements and may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies themselves may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#151; large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#151; the fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Russell and Russell makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the fund's policy that under normal circumstances it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in these stocks; typically, the actual percentage is considerably higher. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund generally gives the same weight to a given stock as the index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the index in anticipation of their removal from the index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the index in anticipation of their addition to the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of the small-cap sector of the U.S. equity market. The index is a subset of the Russell 3000&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Index, representing approximately the 2000 smallest issuers and, as of December 31, 2012, approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000 Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that naturally exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund potentially can offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. In addition, any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that its comparative index is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005912_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;   Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund primarily follows the small-cap portion of the U.S. stock market, as measured by the index. It follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks. Stock prices of smaller companies may be based in substantial part on future expectations rather than current achievements and may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies themselves may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments - bonds or large-cap stocks, for instance - the fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund&amp;#8217;s operating expenses remain the same.

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000006551_Member">To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests a substantial amount of its assets in equity securities of companies outside the United States. The fund expects to invest in companies across all market capitalization ranges. The fund typically focuses on developed markets, but may invest in companies from emerging markets as well. In determining whether a company is international, the portfolio managers will consider various factors, including where the company is headquartered, where the company's principal operations are located, where the company's revenues are derived, where the principal trading market is located and the country in which the company was legally organized. The weight given to each of these factors will vary depending on the circumstances in a given case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM) allocates portions of the fund's assets to several investment managers, who then manage their respective portions under the general supervision of CSIM. In choosing the investment managers and their allocations, CSIM considers a number of factors, including global economic trends, its own outlook for a given market capitalization or investment style category and regions and countries that offer the greatest potential for growth, and the investment managers' performance in various market conditions. In addition to monitoring and coordinating the investment managers, CSIM also manages the cash portion of the fund. CSIM may also directly manage portions of the fund during transitions between investment managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each investment manager uses its own securities selection process and has discretion to select portfolio securities for its allocation of the fund's assets. At the same time, each investment manager invests within a specific market capitalization range and investment style under the general supervision of CSIM. CSIM has developed parameters for each investment manager based on CSIM's assessment of the investment manager's investment style and expertise. By assigning more specific parameters to each investment manager, CSIM attempts to capitalize on the strengths of each investment manager and to combine their investment activities in a complementary fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; CSIM may use derivatives, primarily futures contracts, to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. In addition, the investment managers may use futures contracts as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset or to increase returns. The fund may invest in forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risks associated with the purchase of individual securities denominated in a particular currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. In addition, one investment manager may purchase portfolio securities at the same time that another investment manager sells the same securities. As a result, the fund's portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000006550_Member">Under normal circumstances, the fund pursues its goal by investing at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of companies with small market capitalizations or investments with similar economic characteristics, such as futures. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. Companies with small market capitalizations generally are those with market capitalizations of $2.5 billion or less but may include companies with market capitalizations of up to $5 billion, so long as the purchase of those securities would not cause the average weighted market capitalization of the fund to exceed $3 billion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM) allocates portions of the fund's assets to several investment managers, who then manage their respective portions under the general supervision of CSIM. In choosing the investment managers and their allocations, CSIM considers a number of factors, including market trends, its own outlook for a given market capitalization or investment style category, and the investment managers' performance in various market conditions. In addition to monitoring and coordinating the investment managers, CSIM also manages the cash portion of the fund. CSIM may also directly manage portions of the fund during transitions between investment managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each investment manager uses its own securities selection process and has discretion to select portfolio securities for its allocation of the fund's assets. At the same time, each investment manager invests within a specific market capitalization range and investment style under the general supervision of CSIM. CSIM has developed parameters for each investment manager based on CSIM's assessment of the investment manager's investment style and expertise. By assigning more specific parameters to each investment manager, CSIM attempts to capitalize on the strengths of each investment manager and to combine their investment activities in a complementary fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSIM may use derivatives, primarily futures contracts, to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. In addition, the investment managers may use futures contracts as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset or to increase returns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. In addition, one investment manager may purchase portfolio securities at the same time that another investment manager sells the same securities. As a result, the fund's portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs may rise, which may lower fund performance and increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000006551_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investment managers attempt to reduce the impact of the performance of any given investment style by investing in both value and growth style stocks. But whenever value stocks fall out of favor with investors, they may underperform growth stocks, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large- and mid-cap stocks, and may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; large-cap and mid-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As with all actively managed funds, the strategies of the fund's managers &amp;#8212; its investment adviser and investment managers &amp;#8212; may not achieve their desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Large- and Mid-Cap Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Both large- and mid-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. However, stocks of mid-cap companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies. During a period when large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; small-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's large- and mid-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As a result of the fund's investments in securities denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. This is the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. If such an event occurs, the dollar value of an investment in the fund would be adversely affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund's investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-Manager Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Although CSIM monitors and seeks to coordinate the overall management of the fund, each investment manager makes investment decisions independently, and it is possible that the investment styles of the investment managers may not complement one another. As a result, the fund's exposure to a given stock, industry or investment style could unintentionally be smaller or larger than if the fund had a single manager.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000005522_Member">The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of other Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds. The fund may also invest in unaffiliated third party mutual funds (referred to herein as unaffiliated funds and, together with Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds, the underlying funds). The fund invests in the underlying funds in accordance with its target portfolio allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds) in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The fund is managed based on the specific retirement date (target date) included in its name and assumes a retirement age of 65. The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely would stop making new investments in the fund. The fund is designed for an investor who anticipates retiring at or about the target date and plans to withdraw the value of the investor's account in the fund gradually after retirement. As described below, the adviser will continue to modify the fund's target asset allocation for 20 years beyond the target date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund's target asset allocation will be adjusted annually based on the adviser's asset allocation strategy; however, the adviser reserves the right to modify the fund's target asset allocations from time to time should circumstances warrant a change. In general, the fund's allocation to equity securities will decrease and its allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the fund approaches its target retirement date. The fund's asset allocation as of January 7, 2013 was approximately 59% equity securities, 37% fixed income securities, and 4% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). At the stated target date, the fund's allocation will be approximately 40% equity securities, 54% fixed income securities, and 6% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds). The fund will continue to reduce its allocation to equity securities for 20 years beyond the fund's stated target date. At such time, the fund's asset allocation will remain fixed at approximately 25% equity securities, 66% fixed income securities, and 9% cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the strategic annual adjustment of the fund's target asset allocation, the adviser may adjust the fund's underlying fund allocations within a particular asset class based on the following considerations including, but not limited to, market trends, its outlook for a given market capitalization, and the underlying funds' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular underlying fund may increase or decrease throughout the year. Within the equity asset class, the fund will have exposure to one or more "style classes". For example, the style classes include domestic large-cap equity, domestic small-cap equity, and international equity. The adviser may adjust the fund's allocation to a particular style class based on the following considerations: market trends, its outlook for a given style class, and the style classes' performance in various market conditions. Accordingly, the fund's allocation to a particular style class within the equity asset class may increase or decrease throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fund intends to invest in a combination of underlying funds; however, the fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market securities. For temporary defensive purposes during unusual economic or market conditions or for liquidity purposes, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets directly in cash, money market instruments, repurchase agreements and other short-term obligations. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment objective.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

Securities are grouped in order of decreasing score and each company receives a weight based on the total weights of the companies within the Russell Index. Companies are split at the 87.5% point based on fundamental weights. Companies below this breakpoint make up the Index. The Index uses a partial quarterly reconstitution methodology in which the Index is split into four equal segments at the annual reconstitution and each segment is then rebalanced on a rolling quarterly basis. The Index is compiled and calculated by Russell Investments in conjunction with Research Affiliates LLC, and the method of calculating the components of the Index is subject to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the fund's policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 90% of its net assets in stocks included in the Index. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will generally give the same weight to a given stock as the Index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a stock, the investment adviser may cause the fund's weighting of a stock to be more or less than the Index's weighting of the stock. The fund may sell securities that are represented in the Index in anticipation of their removal from the Index, or buy securities that are not yet represented in the Index in anticipation of their addition to the Index. The fund does not hedge its exposure to foreign currencies. However, the fund may use forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for the portfolio securities purchased or sold, but awaiting settlement. These transactions establish a rate of exchange that can be expected to be received upon settlement of the securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund uses an "indexing" investment approach, which attempts to replicate, before expenses, the performance of the Index by purchasing a basket of securities that compose the Index. Using this approach, the investment adviser seeks a correlation, over time, of 0.95 or better between the fund's performance and the performance of the Index; a figure of 1.00 would represent perfect correlation. However, it is possible that the investment adviser may determine to utilize instead a "sampling" methodology in seeking to achieve the fund's objective. Sampling means that the investment adviser uses quantitative analysis to select stocks from the Index universe to obtain a representative sample of stocks that resembles the Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics. In certain circumstances it may not be possible or practicable for the fund to invest in all of the stocks comprising the Index or in proportion to their weightings in the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no guarantee that the performance of the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation with that of the Index. A number of factors may affect the fund's ability to achieve a high correlation with its Index, including the degree to which the fund utilizes a sampling technique. The correlation between the performance of the fund and its Index may also diverge due to transaction costs, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances, and differences between the fund's portfolio and the Index resulting from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the fund but not to the Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Like many index funds, the fund also may invest in derivatives, principally futures contracts, and lend its securities to minimize the gap in performance that exists between any index fund and its corresponding index. This gap occurs mainly because, unlike the Index, the fund incurs expenses and must keep a small portion of its assets in cash for business operations. By using futures, the fund can gain market exposure and potentially offset a portion of the gap attributable to its cash holdings. Any income realized through securities lending may help reduce the portion of the gap attributable to expenses. In addition, the fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fund may concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries to the extent that the Index the fund is designed to track is also so concentrated.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <rr:RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000019901_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal risks &lt;/b&gt;</rr:RiskHeading>
  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_27Feb2012_28Feb2013S000019901_Member">The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund's principal risks include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Stock markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities market as a whole. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investment Style Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund invests in companies outside the U.S. stock market, as measured by the index. It follows these stocks during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund's expenses, the fund's performance may be below that of the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant percentage of the index may be composed of securities in a single industry or sector of the economy. If the fund is focused in an industry or sector, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Historically, small-cap stocks have been riskier than large-cap stocks, and their prices may move sharply, especially during market upturns and downturns. Small-cap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. During a period when small-cap stocks fall behind other types of investments &amp;#8212; large-cap stocks, for instance &amp;#8212; the fund's small-cap holdings could reduce performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk. &lt;/b&gt;As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its comparative index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and its index, positive or negative, is called "tracking error." Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the index, or match the securities' weightings to the index, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the fund's or the index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of issuers in a particular market, industry, group of industries, sector, country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that market, industry, group of industries, sector, country or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Investment Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund's investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately larger impact on the fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Risk. &lt;/b&gt;A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sampling Index Tracking Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent the fund uses a sampling method, the fund will not fully replicate its comparative index and may hold securities not included in the index. As a result, the fund will be subject to the risk that the investment adviser's investment management strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. If the fund utilizes a sampling approach, it may not track the return of the index as well as it would if the fund purchased all of the securities in the index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange Traded Funds ("ETFs") Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The fund may purchase shares of ETFs to gain exposure to a particular portion of the market while awaiting an opportunity to purchase securities directly. When the fund invests in an ETF, in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations, it will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. Therefore, it may be more costly to own an ETF than to own the underlying securities directly. In addition, while the risks of owning shares of an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities the ETF is designed to track, lack of liquidity in an ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the risks of investing in the fund, please see the "Fund details" section in the prospectus.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>
