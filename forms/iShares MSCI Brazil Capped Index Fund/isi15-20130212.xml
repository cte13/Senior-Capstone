  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000018072_Member">The Underlying Index is an index designed to measure broad-based equity market performance in Thailand. The Underlying Index consists of stocks traded primarily on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The Underlying Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight and all issuers with weight above 5% do not exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. Components primarily include energy, financial and materials companies. The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, may change over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BFA uses a &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to &amp;#8220;beat&amp;#8221; the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. &amp;#8220;Representative sampling&amp;#8221; is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to the Underlying Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund will at all times invest at least 90% of its assets in the securities of the Underlying Index or in depositary receipts representing securities in its Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Underlying Index is sponsored by an organization (the &amp;#8220;Index Provider&amp;#8221;) that is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index. The Fund&amp;#8217;s Index Provider is MSCI Inc. (&amp;#8220;MSCI&amp;#8221;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry Concentration Policy.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e., hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries, which may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies, to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000018072_Member">As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share ("NAV"), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Class Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general securities markets or other asset classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk. &lt;/b&gt;To the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in a particular issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class, the Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse occurrences affecting that issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Custody Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Less developed markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Energy Sector Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, without limitation, changes in energy prices, government regulations, energy conservation efforts and potential civil liabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Equity securities are subject to changes in value and their values may be more volatile than other asset classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Sector Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Performance of companies in the financial sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, government regulations, economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, changes in interest rates, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. This sector has experienced significant losses in the recent past, and the impact of more stringent capital requirements and of recent or future regulation on any individual financial company or on the sector as a whole cannot be predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geographic Risk. &lt;/b&gt;A natural or other disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk. &lt;/b&gt;There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions are likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund's ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issuer Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Fund performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk. &lt;/b&gt;As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment management strategy may not produce the intended results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Trading Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials Sector Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Companies in the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, depletion of resources, over-production, litigation and government regulations, among other factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a Thai issuer or market. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Asian Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;U.S. Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund's investments in emerging markets may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation risk, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Thailand. &lt;/b&gt;Investments in Thai issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific to Thailand. Among other things, Thailand's economy is heavily dependent on trading relationships with certain key trading partners, including the United States, China, Japan and other Asian countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The geographic area in which the Fund invests has experienced security concerns. Incidents involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in Thai markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structural Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund's portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund's holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>
  <rr:PortfolioTurnoverTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000004256_Member">The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or &amp;#8220;turns over&amp;#8221; its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 17% of the average value of its portfolio.</rr:PortfolioTurnoverTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000004256_Member">The Underlying Index consists of stocks traded primarily on the Madrid Stock Exchange. The Underlying Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight and all issuers with weight above 5% do not exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. Components primarily include financial, telecommunications and utilities companies. The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, may change over time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BFA uses a &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to &amp;#8220;beat&amp;#8221; the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. &amp;#8220;Representative sampling&amp;#8221; is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to the Underlying Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Fund will at all times invest at least 80% of its assets in the securities of its Underlying Index and in depositary receipts (&amp;#8220;DRs&amp;#8221;) representing securities in its Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in other securities, including securities not in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index, and in other investments, including futures contracts, options on futures contracts, other types of options and swaps related to its Underlying Index, as well as cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Underlying Index is sponsored by an organization (the &amp;#8220;Index Provider&amp;#8221;) that is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index. The Fund&amp;#8217;s Index Provider is MSCI Inc. (&amp;#8220;MSCI&amp;#8221;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Industry Concentration Policy.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e., hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries, which may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies, to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a Spanish issuer or market. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;European Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners.

The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;European Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Spain.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in Spanish issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific to Spain. Among other things, Spain&amp;#8217;s economy has been characterized by slow growth over the past few years due to factors such as low housing sales and construction declines, and the international credit crisis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Security Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The geographic area in which the Fund invests has experienced security concerns.

The Underlying Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight and all issuers with weight above 5% do not exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. Components primarily include energy, financial and materials companies. The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, may change over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; BFA uses a &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective.

Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. &amp;#8220;Representative sampling&amp;#8221; is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to the Underlying Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Fund generally invests at least 95% of its assets in the securities of its Underlying Index and in depositary receipts (&amp;#8220;DRs&amp;#8221;) representing securities in its Underlying Index.

Any negative changes in commodity markets could have an adverse impact on the Chilean economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in a particular issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class, the Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse occurrences affecting that issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Custody Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Less developed markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity securities are subject to changes in value and their values may be more volatile than other asset classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Performance of companies in the financial sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, government regulations, economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, changes in interest rates, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. This sector has experienced significant losses in the recent past, and the impact of more stringent capital requirements and of recent or future regulation on any individual financial company or on the sector as a whole cannot be predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geographic Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A natural or other disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk.&lt;/b&gt; There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective.

Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment management strategy may not produce the intended results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Trading Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a Chilean issuer or market. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Central and South American Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privatization Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests has privatized, or has begun a process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Asian Economic Risk, Central and South American Economic Risk, European Economic Risk &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;U.S. Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Chile.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in Chilean issuers involve risks that are specific to Chile, including legal, regulatory, political, currency, environmental and economic risks. Among other things, the Chilean economy is heavily dependent on export of certain commodities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund's investments in emerging markets may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation risk, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower  of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structural Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund&amp;#8217;s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities Sector Risk. &lt;/b&gt;The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of complying with regulations, among other factors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security&amp;#8201;and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000004258_Member">The Underlying Index consists of stocks traded primarily on the Stock Market Division of the Korean Exchange. The Underlying Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight and all issuers with weight above 5% do not exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. Components primarily include consumer discretionary, financial, industrials and information technology companies. The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, may change over time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BFA uses a &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to &amp;#8220;beat&amp;#8221; the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. &amp;#8220;Representative sampling&amp;#8221; is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to the Underlying Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Fund will at all times invest at least 80% of its assets in the securities of its Underlying Index and in depositary receipts (&amp;#8220;DRs&amp;#8221;) representing securities in its Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in other securities, including securities not in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index, and in other investments, including futures contracts, options on futures contracts, other types of options and swaps related to its Underlying Index, as well as cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Underlying Index is sponsored by an organization (the &amp;#8220;Index Provider&amp;#8221;) that is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index. The Fund&amp;#8217;s Index Provider is MSCI Inc. (&amp;#8220;MSCI&amp;#8221;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Industry Concentration Policy.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e., hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries, which may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies, to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated.

Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the expiration of a patent may adversely affect their profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may result in price discounting, and may be thinly capitalized and susceptible to product obsolescence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk.&lt;/b&gt; There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective.

International trade is a large component of the Swiss economy and Switzerland depends upon exports to generate economic growth. The Swiss economy relies on certain key trading partners in order to sustain continued economic growth.

Recently, the Italian government experienced significant budget deficits and a high amount of public debt, causing credit agencies to lower Italy&amp;#8217;s sovereign debt rating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structural Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund&amp;#8217;s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of complying with regulations, among other factors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security&amp;#8201;and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Class Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general securities markets or other asset classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commodity Exposure Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in Mexico, which is susceptible to fluctuations in certain commodity markets. Any negative changes in commodity markets could have an adverse impact on the Mexican economy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk&lt;/b&gt;. To the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in a particular issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class, the Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse occurrences affecting that issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consumer Staples Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The consumer staples sector may be affected by marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Custody Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Less developed markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity securities are subject to changes in value and their values may be more volatile than other asset classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geographic Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A natural or other disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk. &lt;/b&gt; There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions are likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issuer Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Fund performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment management strategy may not produce the intended results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Trading Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Companies in the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, depletion of resources, over-production, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a Mexican issuer or market. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;North American Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privatization Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests has privatized, or has begun a process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Central and South American Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;North American Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund's investments in emerging markets may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation risk, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Mexico.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in Mexican issuers involve risks that are specific to Mexico, including legal, regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risks. In the past, Mexico has experienced high interest rates, economic volatility and high unemployment rates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The geographic area in which the Fund invests has experienced security concerns. Incidents involving Mexico's security may cause uncertainty in Mexican markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Telecommunications Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Companies in the telecommunications sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation and obsolescence of telecommunications products and services due to technological advancement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund&amp;#8217;s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security&amp;#8201;and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology.

This sector has experienced significant losses in the recent past, and the impact of more stringent capital requirements and of recent or future regulation on any individual financial company or on the sector as a whole cannot be predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Geographic Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A natural or other disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk.&lt;/b&gt; There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions are likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Issuer Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Fund performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment management strategy may not produce the intended results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Trading Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Companies in the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, depletion of resources, over-production, litigation and government regulations, among other factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a Brazilian issuer or market. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Central and South American Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Privatization Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests has privatized, or has begun a process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Asian Economic Risk, Central and South American Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt; and&lt;b&gt; U.S. Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Brazil.&lt;/b&gt; Investment in Brazilian issuers involves risks that are specific to Brazil, including legal, regulatory, political and economic risks. The Brazilian economy has historically been exposed to high rates of inflation and a high level of debt, each of which may prohibit economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund's investments in emerging markets may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation risk, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Structural Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund&amp;#8217;s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security&amp;#8201;and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Asset Class Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general securities markets or other asset classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in a particular issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class, the Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse occurrences affecting that issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable income and consumer preferences, social trends and marketing campaigns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Custody Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Less developed markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity securities are subject to changes in value and their values may be more volatile than other asset classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Financial Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Performance of companies in the financial sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, government regulations, economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, changes in interest rates, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. This sector has experienced significant losses in the recent past, and the impact of more stringent capital requirements and of recent or future regulation on any individual financial company or on the sector as a whole cannot be predicted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Geographic Risk.&lt;/b&gt; A natural or other disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk.&lt;/b&gt; There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions are likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Industrials Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The industrials sector may be affected by changes in the supply and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product liability and general economic conditions, among other factors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Information Technology Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Issuer Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Fund performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment management strategy may not produce the intended results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Market Trading Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a South Korean issuer or market, including as a result of heightened tensions between North and South Korea. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Asian Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;Asian Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;U.S. Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund's investments in emerging markets may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation risk, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in South Korea.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in South Korean issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks that are specific to South Korea. In addition, economic and political developments of South Korean neighbors may have an adverse effect on the South Korean economy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Security Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The geographic area in which the Fund invests has experienced security concerns. Incidents involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in these markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Structural Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund&amp;#8217;s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security&amp;#8201;and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000004257_Member">The Underlying Index consists of stocks traded primarily on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The Underlying Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight and all issuers with weight above 5% do not exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. Components primarily include energy, financial, industrials and materials companies. The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, may change over time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BFA uses a &amp;#8220;passive&amp;#8221; or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to &amp;#8220;beat&amp;#8221; the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. &amp;#8220;Representative sampling&amp;#8221; is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to the Underlying Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fund generally invests at least 90% of its assets in the securities of its Underlying Index and in depositary receipts (&amp;#8220;DRs&amp;#8221;) representing securities in its Underlying Index. The Fund will at all times invest at least 80% of its assets in the securities of the Underlying Index or in DRs representing securities in its Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in other securities, including securities not in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index, and in other investments, including futures contracts, options on futures contracts, other types of options and swaps related to its Underlying Index, as well as cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Underlying Index is sponsored by an organization (the &amp;#8220;Index Provider&amp;#8221;) that is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index. The Fund&amp;#8217;s Index Provider is MSCI Inc. (&amp;#8220;MSCI&amp;#8221;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry Concentration Policy.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e., hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries, which may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies, to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</rr:StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>

  <rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_02Jan2012_01Jan2013S000004257_Member">As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset Class Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general securities markets or other asset classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concentration Risk.&lt;/b&gt; To the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in a particular issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class, the Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse occurrences affecting that issuer, region, country, market, industry or asset class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Energy Sector Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, without limitation, changes in energy prices, government regulations, energy conservation efforts and potential civil liabilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Equity securities are subject to changes in value and their values may be more volatile than other asset classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Sector Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Performance of companies in the financial sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, government regulations, economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, changes in interest rates, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. This sector has experienced significant losses in the recent past, and the impact of more stringent capital requirements and of recent or future regulation on any individual financial company or on the sector as a whole cannot be predicted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Index-Related Risk.&lt;/b&gt; There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions are likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industrials Sector Risk&lt;/b&gt;. The industrials sector may be affected by changes in the supply and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product liability and general economic conditions, among other factors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issuer Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Fund performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management Risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment management strategy may not produce the intended results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Trading Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials Sector Risk. &lt;/b&gt;Companies in the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, depletion of resources, over-production, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk.&lt;/b&gt;  The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting an Austrian issuer or market. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;European Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passive Investment Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund is not actively managed and BFA does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. The Fund is specifically exposed to &lt;b&gt;European Economic Risk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of Investing in Austria.&lt;/b&gt; Investments in Austrian issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific to Austria. The Austrian economy, along with certain other European Union (&amp;#8220;EU&amp;#8221;) economies, experienced a significant economic slowdown during the recent financial crisis. The Austrian economy is also heavily dependent on trade with other European countries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Lending Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the Fund's loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of the collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking Error Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs, the Fund&amp;#8217;s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends, changes to the Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valuation Risk.&lt;/b&gt; The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security&amp;#8201;and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares.</rr:RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"). Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions.</link:footnote>
